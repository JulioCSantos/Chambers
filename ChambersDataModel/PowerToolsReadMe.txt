You need to do some setup for your app after "Reverse Engineer" has created the Entity Model classes and DbContext for you. 

Here are some hints:

## ASP.NET Core 6.0

1. Register your data context class in your "Program.cs" file.

    builder.Services.AddSqlServer<ChambersDbContext>(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));

2. Add "ConnectionStrings" to your configuration file (secrets.json, appsettings.Development.json or appsettings.json).

    {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
            "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=ASUS-STRANGE;Initial Catalog=ELChambers;Integrated Security=True"
        }
    }
